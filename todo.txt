improvements
	set up test and prod on a domain, then link those to github branches
	there's a short loading period while the json loads, would be nice if there was an indicator that was happening.
	would also be nice if we could use an actual json file rather than one hacked into js

	streamline json file to improve performance
	fix the css so that the sidebar is always as tall as the whole page
